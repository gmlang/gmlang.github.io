### About me

I am a data scientist. And I work for myself by providing analytic solutions and machine learning models to companies. I love my work.

I also enjoy tango dancing, running, swimming, reading and cooking.

I used to live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where I went to graduate school and 
started [Cabaceo](https://cabaceo.com), a data science consulting company. Now I am a digital nomad and currently staying in Seoul to wait out COVID.

I have a BA in math from New College of Florida and a MS in biostatistics from the University of Michigan.

### A random fact

I had a near-death experience at Berthoud Pass. I got lost in the snowy wilderness, and had to climb up and down a tree to stay warm throughout the night. I hiked out the next morning following the sound of cars from the highway.
