Welcome to my site. My name is Guangming Lang. I'm a data scientist and R programmer. I help businesses solve mission critical problems using advanced data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms and web technologies. I do it in front of my Mac and over the internet. I love my work. 

I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is both vibrant and quiet depending on different times of the year. Its vibrance gives me excitement. Its quietness helps me think and stay productive. I love Ann Arbor. 

I also love swimming and reading, which I do regularly if not every day.

I used to love the Argentine tango with all my passion, and I danced and lived a tango life style for 6 years. One day, a near death experience changed my outlook on life. I became very conscious of the fleeting nature of time, and started to develop a strong desire for creating something that can outlive me myself. In tango, you deliver happiness to two people: you and the woman in your embrace. Now, I want to deliver happiness to millions of people. So I quit tango, and began channelling all the passion, creativity and hardwork into building and growing [Cabaceo](http://cabaceo.com/) and [MasterR](http://masterr.org). I'm loving it.
