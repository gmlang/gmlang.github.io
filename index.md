My name is Guangming Lang. I'm a data scientist and R programmer, and I help businesses develop predictive analytics solutions using statistical data analysis methods, machine learning algorithms and web technologies. I do it in front of my Mac and over the internet. I love my work. 

I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is both vibrant and quiet depending on different times of the year. Its vibrance gives me excitement. Its quietness helps me think and stay productive. I love Ann Arbor. 

I also love swimming, rowing, reading, playing the ukulele and singing, which I do regularly if not every day. 

Before I started [Cabaceo LLC](https://cabaceo.com), I danced the Argentine tango for 6 years and had a near-death experience near Berthoud Pass.
