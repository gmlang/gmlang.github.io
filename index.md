Hi, my name is Guangming. I'm a data scientist and a R & Python programmer. 
I create analytic solutions and provide consulting services for individuals, 
startups, and small businesses. I do it in front of my MacBook Pro and over the 
internet. When I'm working, I can often enter the flow state. So I love my work.

I also love tango dancing, swimming and reading.

I used to live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where I went to graduate school and 
started my company [Cabaceo LLC](https://cabaceo.com). Now I live as a digital 
nomad, spending a lot of time in Asia and working with my US-based clients 
remotely.

Here's one interesting fact about me:

I had a near-death experience near Berthoud Pass in the Rocky Mountains. I got 
lost in the snowy wilderness, and climbed up and down a big tree to stay warm 
overnight. I hiked out the next morning by following the sound of cars coming 
from the highway.
